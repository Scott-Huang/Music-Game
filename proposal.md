This is a music game using python for CS242

### Abstract

#### Project Purpose
This is a music game that is able to import any music files and generate games to be played.

#### Project Motivation
One of the kinds of games that I usually play is a music game and it is comparably simple to be implemented as an individual project. Since it is difficult to find some good and copyright-free music as the major part of gameplay, I decided to add the functionality to automatically generate a game for any imported music files so that I do not need to take care of copyright problems.
